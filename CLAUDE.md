# Claude Code Instructions

## Session Start Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** At the start of EVERY session, I must:

1. **Announce that I'm tracking prompts and work efforts**
2. **Update CLAUDE_CONVERSATION_LOG.md** with all user prompts word-for-word
3. **Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** with time estimates and work completed
4. **Continue logging throughout the entire session**

## Files to Maintain

- `CLAUDE_CONVERSATION_LOG.md` - Complete conversation history with prompts and responses
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Project overview, time tracking, feature implementation status

## User Requirement

User specifically requested: "Make a note to yourself every time you start to keep track of all my prompts and our work efforts. Tell me you are doing that every time you start."

This requirement was established on 2025-10-26 and must be followed for all future sessions.
