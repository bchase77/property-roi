## Project Overview

This project involves creating a property investment analysis tool which allows the user to enter, analyze, and compare various properties, including existing investments and potential future purchases.

### 1. Database Schema Update
   - **Objective**: Add mortgage payoff dates to the existing database.
   - **Database table to modify**: `properties`
   - **New column**: `mortgage_payoff_date` of type `DATE`.
   - **Migration Script**: Should ensure that existing properties retain data while adding the new column.

### 2. API Update
   - Modify existing API endpoints that handle property data to include the `mortgage_payoff_date` field.
   - Ensure that property retrieval and updates return and accept this new information.

### 3. Update Existing Data
   - If applicable, populate payoff dates for existing properties. This could be done via an admin panel or directly in the database if data is known.

### 4. Create Analysis Dashboard
   - Develop a UI to visualize historical metrics for each property based on existing and new data.
   - Metrics might include ROI, cash flow, adherence to investment strategies, etc.
   - Use a charting library for graphical representation.

### Next Steps
   - Transition to GPT-4o for enhanced support on complex implementation tasks.
   - Focus on database schema changes, API integration, and dashboard construction as priority tasks.
   
### Requirements and Components
1. **Data Entry Component**: For entering and editing property data, including new mortgage information.
2. **Analysis Dashboard Component**: To display ROI, cash flow, and other metrics visually.
3. **Graphical Visualization Component**: To render and project financial data over time.
4. **Edit Component**: For updating existing property data, such as income and expenses.

### Additional Thoughts
- Consider tracking the specific payoff dates for mortgages with regards to different loan structures and strategies.
- Make provisions for potentially expanding the tool to include comparative analyses against other investment classes (e.g., stocks, crypto).
